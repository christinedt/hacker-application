Rationale

Most of my preferences for working environment were established the first day of my internship at CP+B, when everything was more or less set up for me before I had any idea what any of it did. It worked well enough for me and I had no conception of what parts could be changed, so I adapted to it. I honestly had to google what dotfiles were. I'm so down to learn about this though, because I bet coding would be a lot easier if I could make conscious decisions about the process.

I learned to develop using zsh on a Mac while at CP+B, but am currently working with a Bash shell on Windows. I use Sublime on both. I prefer to use Macs if I can.
